## Building the fonts from source
There are no requirements so you can directly download the Glyphs file and work on it. Of course only on a macOS machine (I couldn't use FontLab Studio because my school stopped buying licenses for it and instead focused on Glyphs only, witch is a pain in the +ss because I had to borrow a MacBook Pro from the school's secretary; switching from my pc to mac to work on this family).
